            Hello from the <strong>interactive structures</strong> lab!
          </h1>
          
          <p>
            We investigate and develop interactive design tools that enable digital <strong>fabrication of complex structures</strong> for novice users. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Such engineered structures are known as metamaterials and allow integrating advanced functionality within their structures, propelling a material revolution. We approach metamaterials research from an <em>HCI</em> perspective. We foster the <em>discovery of unknown structures</em> and functionality by enabling non-experts to participate, leveraging their creativity. We support them by developing interactive systems and computational design tools that assist users in modeling and auto-generating the material geometry. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The Interactive Structures lab is led by <a href="http://alexandraion.com/">Prof. Alexandra Ion</a> at the <a href="https://hcii.cmu.edu/">Human-Computer Interaction Institute</a> at Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Science.
